Must compile with JDK 1.5. (This is important for remaining compatible 
with Android.) 

No tabs please.

UTF-8 is the preferred file encoding.

Braces like this please {
  //indent 2-3 spaces
}

The project includes junit.jar, version 3.8.1.
That version is a bit stale, but for the sake of uniformity, please 
use that version of junit for any new tests, if you create any.
