<P><a name="VersionHistory"></a><h2>DATE4J Version History</h2>

<h3>date4j.jar version 1.3.0 (Published May 24, 2012)</h3>
There's a single change in this release. The DateTime constructor that takes a String now also accepts a 'T' separating the 
date and the time, in addition to accepting a single space as a separator. Two examples of the new syntax:
<pre>
2012-05-24T02:03:04
2012-05-24T02:03:04.123456789
</pre>
This change is backwards-compatible. This change was added mainly for compatibility with the <i>input type='datetime-local'</i>
defined by HTML5. It allows browser implementations to submit text of the above syntax. 

<h3>date4j.jar version 1.2.0 (Published June 4, 2011)</h3>
There are two changes in this release. This release is not backwards compatible. 

<P><b>Formatting</b><br>
The <tt>format()</tt> methods have changed implementation. 
The style 'YYYYMMDD', for example, is now permitted. (This corrects an oversight.)

<P>In addition, the text that can be passed to the <tt>format</tt> methods can now take a much wider range of values. 
For example, a valid format String is :
<PRE>'Now: YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss'</PRE>
This text acts like a little template. The preamble 'Now :' is simply echoed, since it contains no formatting symbols.

<P>Such free-form text will often need pairs of escape characters '|', to prevent <tt>h, m, s, a, f,</tt> and so on from being interpreted 
as formatting symbols. For example :
<PRE>'|The date is:|  YYYY-MM-DD'</PRE>

<P><b>DateTime.isValidFormatString(String)</b><br>
This method has been removed. Since the String passed to the <tt>format()</tt> methods has no restrictions, such a 
method no longer makes sense. 

<h3>date4j.jar version 1.1.0 (Published April 13, 2011)</h3>
Sole change: the <tt>toString</tt> method now returns a better result.

<h3>date4j.jar version 1.0.0 (Published April 30, 2010)</h3>
This is the first version of date4j.
